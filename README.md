## Overview

The entire CN course covers all five layers of the **Internet protocol stack**. namely: 
*	The **Application** layer where mails, `http`, websites, etc exist. 
*	The **Transport** layer: `TCP`/`UDP` protocols
*	The **Network** layer: `IP` protocols and routing. 
*	The **Physical** and **Data Link** layers: for packaging and moving data across wires

Kurose & Ross is certainly worth a read. Google's networks course is a recommended supplement for beginners. PowerCert covers speicifc topics that you can search for. The reference books can be read for anyone looking at a deeper insight into design techniques.

# Media Access Control
- Lower layer of __Data Link Layer__, provide addressing and shared media access control.
- 1. Random Access (Contension)
- 2. Controlled Access
- 3. Channel Division

## Random Access
- No pirority, no schedule, transmission is selected __randomly__.
- No central supervisor, transmission could have __collision__.
- To solve the collision, every station have to determine:
  - when can access media?
  - what to do if media is busy?
  - transmission success or failure?
  - what to do if collision happened?
  
### ALOHA
- __Multiple Access__ - send as need
- Whenever a terminal has data, it transmits. Sender finds out whether transmission was successful or experienced a collision by listening to the broadcast from the destination station. Sender retransmits after some random time if there is a collision.

#### Pure ALOHA protocol
```
1. Transmit a frame.
2. IF ACK arrived
3.    done.
4. ELSE
5.    Wait a random time and GOTO 1
```

#### Why need to wait for 2 times of frame transmission time
Vulnerable time is 2 times of frame transmission time ___T<sub>fr</sub>___. <br>
![](fig/ALOHA-Tfr.png)

> EX: <br>
> A pure ALOHA network transmits 200-bit frames on a shared channel of 200 kbps. <br>
> What is the requirement to make this frame collision-free? <br>
> <br>
> Average frame transmission time T<sub>fr</sub> is 200 bits/200 kbps or 1 ms. The vulnerable time is  2 Ã— 1 ms = 2 ms. < br>
> This means no station should send later than 1 ms before this station starts transmission and no station should start sending during the one 1-ms period that this station is sending.

### Slotted ALOHA
- Divide time to different frame transmission time slots.
- Stations can only send at the start time of the slot.
- Collision still could happen but, reduce the vulnerable time a half.

## Carrire Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
- Sense before transmission.
- Reduce collision, reduce retransmit, increase performance.

- Vulnerable time is propagation time <br>

### How to sense the media is busy or available.
- __Persistence Methods__
  - 1-persistent 
    - keep sense until medium is available 
    - transmit if medium is available
    - collision rate is highest
  - non-persistent
    - if medium not available wait for a random time before next sense
  - p-persistnet
    - keep sence until medium is available
    - if medium is available, transmit in probability p
    - wait for next time slot to sence the medium in proability 1 - p
    
## Carrire Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
```
EX:
1. A sent frame at t<sub>1</sub> from A to D
2. C sent frame at t<sub>2</sub> (not detect A's first bit of frame yet) in both sides
3. Collision happened after t<sub>2</sub>
4. C detect collision at t<sub>3</sub>
5. A detect collision at t<sub>4</sub>

- A's transmission time is t<sub>4</sub> - t<sub>1</sub>
- C's transmission time is t<sub>3</sub> - t<sub>2</sub>
```
![](fig/CSMA-CD-ex.png)
- Sender have to detect the collision before transmit its last bit in the frame.
- Since after transmitted the complete frame, station will not keep the frame data and will not sense the medium.
- So the frame transmission time ___T<sub>fr</sub>___ should be twice of the maximum propagation time ___T<sub>p</sub>___.
  - EX: The frame needs ___T<sub>p</sub>___ to arrive the receiver, so does the collision signal, so station should keep transmission in ___2T<sub>p</sub>___.

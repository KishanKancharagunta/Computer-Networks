COURSE OBJECTIVES:
 To develop an understanding of modern network architectures from a design
and performance perspective
 To introduce the student to the major concepts, principles involved in Data Link
Layer and Network Layer
 To provide an opportunity to learn how to maintain QoS in Network &
maintaining of Congestion Control
 To get an idea of Application Layer functionalities and importance of Security in
the Network

# Multiplexing
Multiplexing is the set of techniques that allow the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals across a single data link.
- Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)
- Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
- Time-division multiplexing (TDM) <br>

## Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)
- In FDM, signals generated by each sending device modulate different carrier frequencies. 
- These modulated signals are then combined into a single composite signal that can be transported by the link. <br>

## Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
- The optical fiber data rate is higher than the data rate of metallic transmission cable, 
- Using a fiber-optic cable for a single line wastes the available bandwidth. 
- Multiplexing allows us to combine several lines into one. <br>

## Time-division multiplexing (TDM)
- Each connection occupies a portion of time in the link. <br>

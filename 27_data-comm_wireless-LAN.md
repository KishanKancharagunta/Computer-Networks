- Roaming issue
- The hidden station problem

## 802.11a
- uses 5-GHz band

## 802.11b

## 802.11g
- higher speed extension to 802.11b 
- operates in 2.4GHz band
- compatible with 802.11b devices

# Bluetooth vs. 802.11b
- Both technologies use the 2.4 GHz radio frequency for wireless communications.
- Bluetooth technology is focused on replacing the short cables used to connect consumer electronic devices such as keyboards and mouse devices.
- Bluetooth's range is limited to approximately 3 m to 9.1 m with a raw data rate of 1 Mbps/723 Kbps available.

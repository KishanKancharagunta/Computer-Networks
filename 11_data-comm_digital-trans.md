# Digital to Digital Conversion
## Data vs. Signal Element
- Data element: a bit that represent a piece of information.
- Signal element: the shortest unit of a digital signal.
- data elements per signal elements: __r = data elements / signal elements__

- Data rate (N): the number of data elements (bits) send in one second __(bps)__.
- Signal rate (S): the number of signal elements send in one second __(baud)__.
- Signal rate also called _pulse rate_, _modulation rate_ or _baud rate_.
> Signal rate __S = N/r__ <br>
> or in average __S = c x N x 1/r__ <br>
> where __c__ is the case factor.

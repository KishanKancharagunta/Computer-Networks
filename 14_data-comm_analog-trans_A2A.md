# Analoge to Analoge Conversion
- Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- Frequency Modulation (FM)
- Phase Modulation (PM)

## Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- The carrier signal is modulated so that its amplitude varies with the changing amplitudes of the modulating signal. <br>

## Frequency Modulation (FM)
- The frequency of the carrier signal is modulated to follow the changing voltage level (amplitude) of the modulating signal. <br>

## Phase Modulation (PM)
- The phase of the carrier signal is modulated to follow the changing voltage level (amplitude) of the modulating signal. <br>
